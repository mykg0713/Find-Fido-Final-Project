      <h2>Rescued Cat Making New Friends</h2>
      <h5>BY J. DIAZ, March 4, 2020</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="./assets/blogpics/poll8_1000x523.jpg"></div>
      <p>A woman was walking her dogs when she heard a baby kitten crying. “We tried calling for her but could not find her in the thick layer of trees out behind our farm,” Morgan told Love Meow.

        Morgan, who already owned five cats and dogs, dispatched one of her older pets to investigate. “We took one of our big cats out to where she was crying, and he sniffed her right out,” the animal lover recalled. “She was in a little tree stump.”

        At first, Morgan hesitated to move the tiny creature, whose mother might already be on the way. But as darkness closed in, she knew she had to bring the kitten inside for her own safety. “When it got dark we got nervous about her because we live on a farm where foxes come around a lot,” Morgan said. “So I went out and brought her inside. She couldn’t see a thing and was covered in fleas.”

        Back at the house, Morgan and her partner gave the kitten what appeared to be her first bath, picked the fleas from her fur, and named the baby feline Polly. But the kitten continued crying. She was very scared and probably missed her mother.

        The commotion drove Pax, Morgan’s gentle 12-year-old dog, to come see what all the fuss was about. When Pax saw Polly, he immediately started comforting the frightened kitten. Polly, in turn, quickly stopped crying, started nuzzling the dog, curled up beside him, and then promptly fell asleep.

        Ever since that first encounter, Polly and Pax have been joined at the hip. For the next several weeks, Pax would patiently wait as Morgan bottle-fed Polly – then jump up to groom the kitten as soon as the meal was finished.
      </p>
<p>
        “Before she could bathe herself, Pax would clean all the bottle milk off her,” Morgan recalled. “He has taught her so many dog things, including an off barking noise she makes.”

        Polly and Pax have only grown closer, despite their dramatic difference in size and age.

        Polly – who has grown into a beautiful cat – still follows her favorite senior around the house. Meanwhile, the now 13-year-old dog has nothing but patience for the cat’s playful antics, which include regular playtime and an ongoing obsession with his tail.

        “They sleep together and play with the same toys,” says Morgan. “She loves to race at the speed of light and pole vault off him.”

        Morgan still marvels at how this rescued, flea-bitten kitten found alone in a tree stump has grown up to become Pax’s best friend. Their incredible bond just shows that love and friendship comes in all forms!

      <h2>Obese Chihuahua Loses 14 Pounds And Can Finally Go For Walks</h2>
      <h5>By L. GEORGE, November 13, 2019</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="./assets/blogpics/obese-chihuahua-cleatus-3.jpg"></div>
      <p>It is hard to say no to our dogs when they ask for more treats or scraps of human food, but we must for their health and wellbeing. While it is fine to give your dogs a treat or taste of healthy human food, portion control is key.

        A Chihuahua named Cleatus slowly started to gain weight and slow down after his 12th birthday. The little pup would steal food from the bin and that combined with his decrease in exercise led to him becoming obese. Cleatus weighed a whopping 33 pounds at his heaviest and was unable to walk.
      
        His dad, Austin Lee, would cart him around in a wagon but when Laura Norton, a veterinary technician, moved in she encouraged Lee to have Cleatus examined by a vet.

        Norton said, “But as he got lazier and lazier, we realized there must be something wrong and brought him to the vets and he was diagnosed with an under-active thyroid.
        
        “His metabolism was slowed down making him feel very lethargic which explained his low energy levels.”
      
        Before, Cleatus was provided a full bowl of food to free graze all day and it was filled whenever it was empty. The new routine meant offering him the appropriate amount of food and giving him a specified time to eat it. “The key part was giving him a certain time to eat and then take the bowl away to teach him food isn’t going to be there all day,” said Norton.
      </p>
<p>
        While it took some adjusting for the little dog and his owners, they are all happy and healthy. Cleatus is now at a healthy weight of 19 pounds due to a strict diet, medication, and daily walks.
      
        “Once his thyroid was regulated, his life changed for the better and he is now a completely different dog – he is wild and loves life again.

        “I can’t stress enough to other dog owners to feed their pets healthy food – humans avoid junk food as we know it isn’t good for us and it is the same with dogs,” stated his mom.
      
        Cleatus now enjoys walks with his family and canine brother, Cooper, and can go for a mile without a break. The senior dog is living his best life and has kept the weight off for four years. He just celebrated his 16th birthday!

        “I see overweight dogs and cats every day with owners unaware that it can be fixed. Also how hard is it to diet ourselves? Most of us humans STRUGGLE day in and day out,” posted Norton.
        
        If you notice your pet suddenly gaining weight or if your pet is already overweight, talk to your vet. Simple changes like diet and a slow increase in exercise can make a huge difference.</p>
